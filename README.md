# Security Audit

Web application security audit to be performed once per quarter.

- [ ] Review latest OWASP Top 10
- [ ] Run automatic security checks
  - [ ] Mozilla Observatory: https://observatory.mozilla.org
  - [ ] Google CSP Evaluator: https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/
  - [ ] Security header scanner: https://securityheaders.com/
  - [ ] Lighthouse (Chrome dev tools)
- [ ] Ensure encryption of data in transit (force SSL connections everywhere possible)
- [ ] Ensure encryption of data at rest (databases, harddrives, passwords, etc should be encrypted)
- [ ] Update all dependencies
  - [ ] Use LTS versions (Node.js, Ubuntu, etc)
- [ ] No vulnerabilities found in dependencies (GitHub and npm security reports, etc)
- [ ] Lock down ports (tcp, udp, etc)
  - [ ] Only open ports that are absolutely necessary
  - [ ] Only open the smallest subset of absolutely necessary IP addresses on each port
- [ ] Ensure strong authentication system
  - [ ] Study up on the latest authentication best practices
  - [ ] up-to-date and secure
  - [ ] Cookies, JWTs, private and public keys, web storage, etc all used correctly
- [ ] Ensure strong authorization system
  - [ ] Study up on the latest authorization best practices
  - [ ] Automated tests to ensure data integrity
  - [ ] Physical/logistical access controls should be in place (locking screens, not sharing passwords, etc)
- [ ] Analyze all endpoints and ensure proper authentication and authorization 
  - [ ] All processes that are accessible through tcp/ip ports should be audited to ensure each endpoint has proper           - [ ] Analyze the types of operations, reads or writes, that are permitted
- [ ] Rotate all keys
  - [ ] public and private keys
  - [ ] secrets
  - [ ] passwords (minimum of 10 characters in length)
- [ ] All cryptographic algorithms up-to-date (i.e. do not use sha1)
  - [ ] For example, use a good hashing algorithm
  - [ ] For example, choose a proper ECDSA curve
- [ ] Ensure physical integrity of all keys
  - [ ] You must be able to physically access all keys
  - [ ] Consider having multiple physical locations for each key (these cannot be lost)
  - [ ] Know where all keys are stored (laptop, USB drive, environment variables, cloud storage, safes, etc)
- [ ] Review organizational access control policies
  - [ ] Who has access to what data
  - [ ] Password length
  - [ ] Password lifetimes
  - [ ] Access to secrets
  - [ ] Password sharing
  - [ ] Screen locking
  - [ ] Proper channels for sharing data (Gmail, Slack, Excel, etc)
- [ ]  Revoke access to terminated employees 
  - [ ] Review all user accounts
  - [ ] Ensure all authorizations are current
- [ ] Sanitize data
  - [ ] Know where all sensitive data is stored
  - [ ] Only keep sensitive data that you absolutely must keep, and for no longer than absolutely necessary
- [ ] Review compliance with regulations
  - [ ] Determine what type of data is sensitive
  - [ ] Determine what type of data you are not allowed to store
  - [ ] HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, etc
- [ ] Ensure proper logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Know when there is a breach or attack
- [ ] Audit the audit
  - [ ] Study the latest security practices
  - [ ] Ensure the audit is up-to-date and will lead to sufficient security
